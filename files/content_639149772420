Pros:Picture quality, Sound quality, Great price, Long lasting. Cons:I could not find a single thing wrong. For the price I was impressed. The Bottom Line: This is a great buy for those who do not like spending money on a new TV every year because of malfunctions or dead technology.
I recieved the Vizio E320l-A0 32" 720p HD LED LCD TV for my birthday from a family member. I have had no problems with the TV at all. I use it on a daily basis and picture is still as clean and clear as it was when I took it out of its box. Great TV for gaming. I personally use mine for Playstation 3 gaming as well as Blueray DVD's. I found out that the TV was decently priced so I went and got a couple more for the other rooms in the house.  Two HDMI ports as well as USB and Component. The TV is very light weight for the size and was easy to install with a wall mount.  Perfect for the bedroom or any other room in the house. Great sound and volume as well as picture quality. This TV has lasted for quite awhle and does not look like it is going to break down anytime soon. The screen is very easy to maintain and keep clean just a quick wipe down weekly and your good to go. The TV does not have a huge outer border, The TV is almost all screen which is choice for those who are annoyed by a huge banner around the screen.
