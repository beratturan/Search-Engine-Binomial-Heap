Pros:Sharp picture can be modified to suit conditions; SmartTV features Cons:Lasted only 6 weeks; SmartTV features difficult to configure and use
My inlaws loved their Samsung 46" LED SmartTV HDTV, so we chose it on that basis. Six weeks after installation the picture has disappeared and Samsung, two weeks later, has yet to repair or replace. It was such fun while it lasted. I'd like to recommend this product, but today, you must consider so many factors other than just the unit itself; products are so complex, difficult to repair and expensive that the company's integrity must be factored in as well. The set was very easy to set up; the inputs are easily accessed, and suitable for connecting high-quality components (we have a Bose Entertainment Center and a Wii). The SmartTV features are also exciting, though with advanced cable options, you may find some of them redundant, but among other things, the connection with things like Pandora and Netflix is really useful. The display and picture quality can be tinkered with to suit many different variables. Using the remote, some of the options (such as SOURCE) don't stay on screen very long so you may find yourself having to go through certain menus repeatedly.
