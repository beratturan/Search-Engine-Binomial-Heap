Pros:Good picture, easy to understand controls. Cons:NOISY cooling fan, Hitachi "customer service" The Bottom Line: Don't buy it! You would think for $4,000 Hitachi would use a better quality cooling fan. Get a Panasonic. My 50" Panasonic is flawless!
This is my second plasma TV so I think I know a little about this subject. The Hitachi 4201u is recommended on the website of a respected plasma tv dealer. Since I was looking for a smaller unit for another room I decided to try it. The unit looks good and has a decent picture, but the cooling fan is so noisy, even at a normal listening volume, that it is very distracting. I looked in the owners manual only to find that they say a noisy cooling fan is normal. What? I called Hitachi customer service, and after taking all my information in a rather curt manner they told me they would note my comments. Shades of Big Brother! I asked if that was all they were going to do and they said yes. You would think that when you build a $4,000 TV you would put in a better quality cooling fan. And they could work on their people skills at the customer service department too.
