What is that one thing that makes a house a HOME? Is it the couch? is it your lawn? is it that favorite mug you drink your tea from every morning. Well these are individual likings of our own. Let's think a little harder. How can a family enjoy some good quality time together? Don't stress out! The answer is right here. It is the LG SMART TV. I am not going to start telling you about the gadgets and awesome features this baby has because you could already tell from it's name but i will tell you how it has made family time more fun. Where shall i begin. For the past couple of years i had a normal square tv that sat at our table. Looking at that thing sitting there like some old piece of junk just made me want to break it. I mean it did have channels but it didn't have that touch of magic like my LG smart tv. SITTING across the room ON  my  COUCH YOU COULD BARELY TELL THE PICTURE playing ON THE SCREEN AND TRUST ME MY EYE SIGHT IS A OK. I had to find a way out.I found out about the LG SMART TV at a friends . She has three kids and her hubby. The way they interacted through that tv was so beautiful. Playing online games, looking up recipes, watching intense dramas. I mean what more can you ask for. So me and my family didn't think twice and brang that baby home. Firstly it made the place look more up to date. Second it did magic. It made familiy time only time. My family and i had competitions through the online games. Now we don't even go to the cinema as much. We share laughs and cries through the epic dramas.MARVELOUS PRINT I MUST SAY!  This isn't just a tv it's FAMILY
