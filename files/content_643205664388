Pros:value for dollar spent Cons:remote works fine but could have been engineered for easier use.
I am very happy with my purchase as it provides exceptional value for dollar spent. Picture quality is outstanding, the smart TV function works as advertised and its overall aesthetic appeal is sleek and unassuming.
