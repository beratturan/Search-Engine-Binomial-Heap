Pros:Nice picture Cons:Everything else The Bottom Line: Instead of this, get a "dumb" TV and a Roku3.
This TV has an excellent picture and great input and output options, but the "smart" features are clunky and bug-ridden and the user interface is painful to use and unintuitive.  Just a few examples: It took me most of an afternoon to get the TV to connect wirelessly to my network. The inputs (i.e., HDMI1, HDMI2, etc.)  can be named, but  the TV forgets the names as soon as you turn it off. The Screen aspect ration setting can't be reached via any of the many many menu options. It can only be reached by pressing the "Quick" button on the remote.  My set wants to update its firmware every time I turn it on and the update always fails. It also fails to update from the USB port. I finally  bought a Roku and disconnected the TV from the internet. With the Roku3, I'm very happy with the TV using a Logitech universal remote and an external surround sound system.  The TV is essentially serving as a monitor.   My recommendation is to avoid smart TVs altogether (unless you're excited by the opportunity to have a calendar or your photos and videos from photo upload sites on the TV).  Get a "dumb" TV and a Roku3 -- you'll be much happier.
