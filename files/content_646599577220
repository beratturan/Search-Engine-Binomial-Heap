Pros:Thin profile, vivid picture when viewed head on, great price! Cons:Poor veiwing angle. The Bottom Line: AWESOME buy in the right situation, if viewing from the side...look elsewhere!
I had a funky Sansui stereo growing up years ago...it served me well.  Could this be the same company all these years later? Who knows but that was well enough a reason to go with this inexpensive set over other brands. **OUT OF THE BOX*** The tv is ultra light weight and the thickness is thin thin thin..less than an inch.  The stand assembled with no trouble.  I have the unit in our 12 x 18 master bedroom, in the corner, on a stand about 30" off the ground.  It appears stable. Its more than large enough sitting 7 or so feet from our bed. ***HOOK UP **** There are HDMI inputs...you can look up the specs. I was not too worried about that because this size set will likely be used in a bedroom.  We have cable, I am using the coax input. I also have a dvd hooked via old style rca jacks...nothing fancy here. ***PICTURE QUALITY *** Sitting in bed in front of this tv, even with the coax, the picture is sharp, vivid, clear and beautifull. I have no complaints.  HOWEVER...please please note...if you are going to be watching this set from an angle the picture fades. In other words the viewing angle is really bad!  I'd assume the same if mounted on a wall pointing downward.  For us, we are always laying right in front of it, enjoying the awesome picture.  However if I get and walk to the side....Booooo!  Not a problem for us but if I were to often sit off center on a regular basis, this set would have been returned. ***SOUND QUALITY *** The sound is not as good as my old box tv....but it never is with these sets.  You adjust quickly and to be honest I have no issue with the sound quality. ***NOTE*** I have had the set 9 months or so with no issues...well almost none. I have noticed that sometimes when I turn I set on, for the first few minutes I hear a crackling sound. Its not horribly loud. In fact my wife has never said anything and I admit I notice every little sound everywhere. Still, I do not think a tv should do this.  It goes away after a few minutes but what the heck is going on? Its too inconsistent at this point for a service call. I did buy a service contract at Bjs where I got it so i am covered. I figure worst case they refund the price of the tv. Usually buy then, the refund would buy a similar if not bigger tv. Overall, cautiously happy after 9 months.
