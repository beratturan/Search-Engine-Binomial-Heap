Pros:Picture Quality 3 HDMI Ports Cons:Bezel size is pretty big
I bought this TV for less than 300$ + shipping. The quality of the picture for the price I paid is really good, plus I like that it has 3 HDMI ports. The picture is even better on non-high-def channels than my old Samsung 24 inch LCD that this one replaced. The viewing angles are better, too. One thing that bothers me some is the bezel--it's pretty big on this TV. However...overall, I am pleased with this purchase.
