Pros:Picture quality, estetics, features Cons:Does not play wmv type files, which are blocked by Sony The Bottom Line: Do not buy Sony, Panasonic and Hisense TV. They all block MS files type wmv.
Warning: Do no buy SONY, Panasonic or Hisense Smart TV. They all block Microsoft medial files (*.wmv). I bought Sony 55" LCD, Smart TV but it was made under very dumb management. I have hundreds of home movies made with MS Windows Movie Maker. In ...horror I noticed that all these movies had permanent notice right across in the middle of screen saying that Audio files are not compatible. They did not even allow to watch those movies without sound, because the sign was in the middle of screen. This is idiocy of extreme promotion. I did not use any music in my test movies, just sound of engine or people talking. Those idiots blocked the second most popular media format in the world. Those two formats are MP4 own by Apple and WMV own by Microsoft. I had to dismantle that huge TV, pack it up and returned it. I went through several stores and ask the sales people about this nonsense and nobody knew abut it. I created test files and we tested Sony in several stores to educate those sale people, Panasonic which totally hid *.wmv files and I think also *.avi files, but I am not sure now. Vision carries new TV brand Hisense, which was the same block. Eventually I bought 50" LG Smart TV (50LA6205) and it is totally amazing unit.
