Pros:GREAT apps easy to use  Cons:Nothing The Bottom Line: I recomend evryone to buy one, you wont need a dvd player any more, or radios, the tv already has them built into it it is greqat to have
I got thios around christmas time of last year, I love this tv. it has pandora youtube netflix and much more already added into it. I use these apps almost everyday! i was very confused how to use it at first but after a week or so i really got the hang of it. almost everything i own is samsung brand!. evrything on this tv works perfectly. qand i have never had any problems with it once. I would deffinitly reccomend this tv to everyone that i know. It has so mant things to do on it. its almost like having your computer and tv all built into one.! and the price was just right for it! My sister actually went and bought one for herself after seeing mine and using it. she loves it. Its the best brand of tv ever made. i would not have bought any other brand! It is very useful and fun to use and have in the house. even for the little kids i babysit, its easy for them to undertand how to use it and play games on it. Again i LOVE this samsung tv. I absolutly do recomend everyone to get one.
