Pros:Perfect Picture Price Ease of Access Cons:None The Bottom Line: I recommend this TV to anybody who is an enthusiast of HD. If on a budget great for a main TV. Easy to hookup and move around if needed. 
I have owned this TV now for a few weeks and I am amazed. I never thought that a TV under $500 would be so clear and crisp. It has made me enjoy watching TV more often just so i can look at it. Especially with live sports it is a huge upgrade from anything I have watched before. Also it is very easy to access the inputs for hooking up all my equipment. Samsung always makes the best electronics and will trust anything they make. I have never been disappointed and this has exceeded expectations. I will be using this as my main TV for years to come and cant wait to hook up a PS4 to it to see how it really performs. With everything being HD why would not want the best you can buy. It is very light, too, so it is easy to move around if needed. I have moved it around my house hooking it up to computers and tablets for parties and NFL Sundays. All my friends have complimented it and wished they had one this easy to use  Although it is only a 60Hz refresh rate it has such a good picture that it doesnt matter and at this price it doesnt get much better. Anybody looking in to buying this TV must do it. I recommend this to anybody on a budget looking for the best.
