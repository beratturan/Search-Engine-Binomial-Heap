Pros:Pretty picture on regualr TV Cons:Horrible customer service .. left on hold, lied to. No consideration to my unique wireless problem. The Bottom Line: Stay away from Samsung.  I paid for a Smart TV with a wireless feature and didn 't get it.  Samsung treated me like a liar.
I bought thiis model a year ago but did not try to use the "Smart  wireless feature (to access Netflix) until 12/4/2013. I used the regular TV feature for  6 months and then left town for 6 months. The set would not recognize the  wireless. Upon my return, I resolved to try to get the wireless feature to work, thinking it was a problem with Comcast.   I had a Comcast repair tech check it out and he advised that the Samsung TV was defective.  I contacted  Samsung and explained my problem .. and they turned me down .. said I would have to pay for  a service call .. worse yet the cost would be up to the repair technician (My God, a blank check to Samsung?  No Way.) Most importantly, potential buyers should be forewarned about Samsung's horriific customer service.  While trying to resolve my problem, I was put on hold and left there twice .. on the third call I was told I needed an email update to download, which would be followed by a phone call to insure I was satisfied.  No email and no phone call.   The final call  told me I needed the service call visit.  I also have an LG TV which is outstanding  .. shame on Samsung.
